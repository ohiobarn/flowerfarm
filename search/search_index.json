Becoming a project member Before you can participate on issues you need to perform a one-time setup and join the ohiobarn/flowerfarm project. You will receive an invitation in your email inbox. The invitation will contain a link that you can use to join the ohiobarn/flowerfarm issues list. Click the link and join and start reviewing the list of issues. Issue List This OBFF issue list is a tool you will use each week to plan and coordinate on specific issues. The goal is for you to plan out your work week, select the issues you want to work on then coordinate with me using the issue list tool to complete each issue as described. The issue UI us intuitive, you should be able to discover/learn many of its features with just a little time using the tool. Below are a few common functions that you will want to learn: Filters : The issues search bar allows you to define your own custom filters and sort by a wide variety of criteria. For example, often you will want to search for open issues with the \"help wanted\" label. For this search you will use the following filter is:issue is:open label:\"help wanted\" , click here to see this search filter used. Milestones : A milestone is used to track a project as part of a larger goal. A milestone is a set of related issues and each milestone marks a major project function. For example, the \"build new green house\" project might have several milestones like planning , purchase supplies , prepare site and bend poles and assemble greenhouse . And each of those milestones will be made up of several issues. The milestone UI is primarily a tool for OBFF planning. As a crew member you many not need to the milestone UI that often, however if you are woking issues that are part of a milestone this UI will be useful for you to understand the priority the issue. Workflow A workflow is the process you will follow to find, work on and complete issues. The following will step you through the a common workflow for finding, working and completing issues: Review the open issues . You are looking for issues labeled help wanted . Read the issue and if you have questions add a comment and ask for clarification and then apply the question label to the issue. Once you find an issue that you can work on, either you have no questions or a previous questions was sufficiently answered, remove the question label, if one exists, and assign yourself to the issue. Assigning yourself to an issue marks the end of the planning phase. Next you will enter the execution phase where you will actually work on the issue. There may be some time between the end of planning and when you actually start working on an issue. For example, you may pickup a painting issue but wait for several weeks for good weather before you actually start work. Therefore, we need a way to signal when you plan to work on an issue. Apply the next label to issues that you plan to work on during your next work day visit. If you don't have a set schedule then please indicate in the issue comments the date of your next visit. When you are finished with the issue simply click the close issue button Note - I encourage you to use the issue comments to have a discussion at any time during the workflow. Simply mentioning @tonygilkerson in the comment and I will respond on the issue. This is expected during the planning phase but even when you are working a issue, it might take you several visit, and new questions may arise. If the question is small the mention is all that is needed, however, if the question is blocking or you don't have supplies apply the blocked label.

This is enough to cover the beds and overlap in between to allow ~2 feet for a walking path 3 drip tape irrigation lines per bed 2 irrigation zones, each zone has 15 drip tape lines Spacing Plan To compute the number of plants per bed; each bed is 48 inches (4 feet) wide and 1,200 inches (100 feet) long, as shown above, and by planting with 9-inch spacing, I can fit ~665 plants in each bed: Plants per width : 48in / 9in spacing = 5.3 plants; rounds down to 5 plants Plants per length : 1200in / 9in spacing = 133.3 plants; rounds down to 133 plants Plants per bed : 5 plants X 133 plants = 665 plants per bed 665 plants per bed, that's 6,650 plants for the entire field Spacing Template Irrigation Setup Flow Knowing your flow rate is critical to sizing your system. I did a flow test with the spigot out in the field. It took about 55 seconds to fill 5 gallon bucket. I used the following formula to compute gallons per hour (GPH). Or you can use the flow calculator from dripworks.com 5 gal 60 sec 60 min 18,000 gal ------ x ------ x ------ = ---------- ~= 327 GPH 55 sec 1 min 1 hr 55 hr Flow Capacity: 327 GPH To provide your lawn with one inch of water takes a little over half a gallon per square foot (0.623 gallon to be more exact). That means that every 10\u2019x10\u2019 area will require over 62 gallons of water. For one 80x4 bed it takes about 200 gal to provide 1\" of water. .623 Gal (80ft x 4 ft bed) --------- x ----------------- = 199.36 ~ 200 gal 1sq ft Using the drip-tape-estimator given 3 beds with 4 drip lines per bed on 80 feet long bed using 8mill 8\" low flow tape I get Total water required: of 192 GPH . I am not sure if I understand correctly but that is about the 200 gal from above so I think it will take: about 1 hour for 1\" of water Soil Type Next we need to know our soil type: Clay - requires a 0.5 GPH emitter Loam - requires a 0.5-1 GPH emitter Sand - requires a 1-2 GPH emitter In my case I am not sure, I will guess loam for now. Loam - requires a 0.5-1 GPH emitter (let's go with 0.75 GPH) Product Selection According to the description Drip Tape sounds best for my situation: Drip Tape is best for long, straight row crops. It is the most economical way to water your plants and is easy to install and maintain. To start I am going to buy a kit. There seems to be two kits that could do the job: drip tape row crop medium drip tape row crop large If I only use two strips of drip tape per row then I could get the medium kit. However, the medium kit leaves no room for error and I feel like 9 inch spacing for the plants is denser than normal so I better go with at least three strips of drip tape per row. Given that I will get the large kit with an extra timer so I can automate two zones. In this blog post Floret says they use four strips of drip tape per four foot bed but they have sandy soil and even say that you could get by with two or three strips if you don't have sandy soil, so that validates my choice. I will be going with the drip tape row crop large kit Zones The drip tape that comes with the large kit uses drip tape part# TA1508L which is rated at Flow per 100 feet is 20 GPH . So that is 20 GPH for each strip of drip tape. I need 30 strips total for the field which would require 600 GPH (20 GPH X 30 strips), but my system can only generate 327 GPH. Therefore, if I split my field into two zone, 5 beds requiring 15 strips each, then each zone will only need 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips) which is less than 327 GPH, so we are good. two zones, each requiring 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips) Germination Station Shelf Layout The image below shows the layout for one shelf of the germination station. Each shelf will be able to hold 288 plants , four starter trays of 72 plants each. 288 plants per shelf Station Each station is a five shelf unit. The top shelf is used for storage and four shelves will be used for germination.

There seems to be two kits that could do the job: drip tape row crop medium drip tape row crop large If I only use two strips of drip tape per row then I could get the medium kit. However, the medium kit leaves no room for error and I feel like 9 inch spacing for the plants is denser than normal so I better go with at least three strips of drip tape per row. Given that I will get the large kit with an extra timer so I can automate two zones. In this blog post Floret says they use four strips of drip tape per four foot bed but they have sandy soil and even say that you could get by with two or three strips if you don't have sandy soil, so that validates my choice.
