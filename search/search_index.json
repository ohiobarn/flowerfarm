On average, your frost-free growing season starts Apr 11 and ends Oct 30, totaling 202 days Spring 2020 in Northern Hemisphere will begin on Thursday, March 19 Flower Field Layout Reference: dripworks planning guide growing with landscape fabric Each bed is 4 feet by 100 feet 10 beds total (5 beds in each irrigation zone) 2 feet between each bed with 6 feet between each zone Landscape fabric is 6 feet wide. This is enough to cover the beds and overlap in between to allow ~2 feet for a walking path 3 drip tape irrigation lines per bed 2 irrigation zones, each zone has 15 drip tape lines Spacing Plan To compute the number of plants per bed; each bed is 48 inches (4 feet) wide and 1,200 inches (100 feet) long, as shown above, and by planting with 9-inch spacing, I can fit ~665 plants in each bed: Plants per width : 48in / 9in spacing = 5.3 plants; rounds down to 5 plants Plants per length : 1200in / 9in spacing = 133.3 plants; rounds down to 133 plants Plants per bed : 5 plants X 133 plants = 665 plants per bed 665 plants per bed, that's 6,650 plants for the entire field Spacing Template Irrigation Setup Flow Knowing your flow rate is critical to sizing your system. I did a flow test with the spigot out in the field. It took about 55 seconds to fill 5 gallon bucket. I used the following formula to compute gallons per hour (GPH). Or you can use the flow calculator from dripworks.com 5 gal 60 sec 60 min 18,000 gal ------ x ------ x ------ = ---------- ~= 327 GPH 55 sec 1 min 1 hr 55 hr Flow Capacity: 327 GPH To provide your lawn with one inch of water takes a little over half a gallon per square foot (0.623 gallon to be more exact). That means that every 10\u2019x10\u2019 area will require over 62 gallons of water. For one 80x4 bed it takes about 200 gal to provide 1\" of water. .623 Gal (80ft x 4 ft bed) --------- x ----------------- = 199.36 ~ 200 gal 1sq ft Using the drip-tape-estimator given 3 beds with 4 drip lines per bed on 80 feet long bed using 8mill 8\" low flow tape I get Total water required: of 192 GPH . I am not sure if I understand correctly but that is about the 200 gal from above so I think it will take: about 1 hour for 1\" of water Soil Type Next we need to know our soil type: Clay - requires a 0.5 GPH emitter Loam - requires a 0.5-1 GPH emitter Sand - requires a 1-2 GPH emitter In my case I am not sure, I will guess loam for now. Loam - requires a 0.5-1 GPH emitter (let's go with 0.75 GPH) Product Selection According to the description Drip Tape sounds best for my situation: Drip Tape is best for long, straight row crops. It is the most economical way to water your plants and is easy to install and maintain. To start I am going to buy a kit. There seems to be two kits that could do the job: drip tape row crop medium drip tape row crop large If I only use two strips of drip tape per row then I could get the medium kit. However, the medium kit leaves no room for error and I feel like 9 inch spacing for the plants is denser than normal so I better go with at least three strips of drip tape per row. Given that I will get the large kit with an extra timer so I can automate two zones. In this blog post Floret says they use four strips of drip tape per four foot bed but they have sandy soil and even say that you could get by with two or three strips if you don't have sandy soil, so that validates my choice. I will be going with the drip tape row crop large kit Zones The drip tape that comes with the large kit uses drip tape part# TA1508L which is rated at Flow per 100 feet is 20 GPH . So that is 20 GPH for each strip of drip tape. I need 30 strips total for the field which would require 600 GPH (20 GPH X 30 strips), but my system can only generate 327 GPH. Therefore, if I split my field into two zone, 5 beds requiring 15 strips each, then each zone will only need 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips) which is less than 327 GPH, so we are good. two zones, each requiring 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips) Germination Station Shelf Layout The image below shows the layout for one shelf of the germination station. Each shelf will be able to hold 288 plants , four starter trays of 72 plants each. 288 plants per shelf Station Each station is a five shelf unit.

This formula can be calculated for N, P or K. Lbs. N recommended / %N in the fertilizer blend x 100 = lbs. fertilizer needed per 1000 sq ft So 10-10-10 all purpose fertilizer is generally available at THD . Lets compute how much of the 10.10.10 is need for P and K, then I will need to supplement for N. # given a 40 lb bag of 10-10-10 40 lbs * 10% N = 4 lbs of N ( which is 4 to 8 lbs short of what we need) 40 lbs * 10% P = 4 lbs of P ( which is what we need) 40 lbs * 10% K = 4 lbs of K ( which is what we need) N sourced from urea To make up the shortfall of N let look at some urea which is rated at 45-0-0 # given a 4 lb bag of 45-0-0 4 lbs * 45% N = 1.8 lbs of N per bag Therefore we would need 4 bags which has 7.2 lbs of N ( 7.2 = 4 * 1.8).

It is the most economical way to water your plants and is easy to install and maintain. To start I am going to buy a kit. There seems to be two kits that could do the job: drip tape row crop medium drip tape row crop large If I only use two strips of drip tape per row then I could get the medium kit. However, the medium kit leaves no room for error and I feel like 9 inch spacing for the plants is denser than normal so I better go with at least three strips of drip tape per row. Given that I will get the large kit with an extra timer so I can automate two zones. In this blog post Floret says they use four strips of drip tape per four foot bed but they have sandy soil and even say that you could get by with two or three strips if you don't have sandy soil, so that validates my choice. I will be going with the drip tape row crop large kit","title":"Product Selection"},{"location":"spring2020/plan/#zones","text":"The drip tape that comes with the large kit uses drip tape part# TA1508L which is rated at Flow per 100 feet is 20 GPH . So that is 20 GPH for each strip of drip tape. I need 30 strips total for the field which would require 600 GPH (20 GPH X 30 strips), but my system can only generate 327 GPH. Therefore, if I split my field into two zone, 5 beds requiring 15 strips each, then each zone will only need 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips) which is less than 327 GPH, so we are good. two zones, each requiring 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips)","title":"Zones"},{"location":"spring2020/plan/#germination-station","text":"","title":"Germination Station"},{"location":"spring2020/plan/#shelf-layout","text":"The image below shows the layout for one shelf of the germination station.

This formula can be calculated for N, P or K. Lbs. N recommended / %N in the fertilizer blend x 100 = lbs. fertilizer needed per 1000 sq ft So 10-10-10 all purpose fertilizer is generally available at THD .
