SOW:

Transplant (recommended).  Sow seed into cell trays or open flats 10-22 weeks before last frost. Cover seeds lightly with fine vermiculite. Bottom water or mist to avoid covering seed with displaced soil. If started in open flats, transplant to cell packs or 3-4"" containers when the first true leaves appear.  Harden off and transplant outside after the last frost.  Black plastic mulch is recommended in areas with short growing seasons. Eucalyptus may be grown as a perennial in areas that receive no frost.  

HARVEST:

Fresh: Harvest anytime after leaves start to feel leathery.  Easily preserved with glycerin.

SOW:

* Sow indoors 10 weeks before last spring frost using a seed starting kit
* Sow seeds ¼ inch deep in seed-starting formula
* Keep the soil moist at 70-75 degrees F
* Seedlings emerge in approximately 21 days
* As soon as seedlings emerge, provide plenty of light 
* Seedlings do not need much fertilizer, feed when they are 3-4 weeks old using a starter solution (half strength of a complete indoor houseplant food) according to manufacturer’s directions.
* If you are growing in small cells, you may need to transplant the seedlings to 3 or 4 inch pots when seedlings have at least 2 pairs of true leaves before transplanting to the garden so they have enough room to develop strong roots.
*  harden off before transplanting out.

1. Before you get started, it's important to gather the proper supplies:
  *  seed trays
  * pots
  * bottom trays
  * potting soil 
  * fertilizer (add to potting soil)
  * vermiculite
  * clear dome lids
  * shop lights
  * plant tags.

2. Moisten potting mix until it is thoroughly damp, but not dripping wet.

3. Add just a little fertilizer to potting soil (i.e. Nature's Intent).  Not much just a light dusting.  Mix in well.

4. Fill seed flats to the top with soil, tapping firmly against the table as you go, so the soil settles and there are no air pockets trapped in the tray cells.

5. Label the tray with the variety name and date sown.

6. Make holes in each cell using your finger, a pencil or a dibbler. A general rule of thumb is to plant the seed twice as deep as it is big.

7. Drop 1-2 seeds into each hole until the tray is completely full.

8. Cover the tray with a light dusting of fine vermiculite or seed starting mix, making sure all seeds are covered.

9. Set freshly sown trays into a plastic tub with an inch of water in the bottom and let them soak up the water from below. Remove once the soil surface is evenly moist. Seed trays should not be watered from overhead until the plants have their first set of true leaves, as one strong blast from the hose will wash tiny seeds away.

10. Cover trays with a clear plastic dome and set onto a 70* heat mat or in a warm corner of the house, consistently above 65*.

11. Check trays daily, and once seeds have sprouted, remove plastic dome lids and move the tray off of the heat mat to a bright space such as a greenhouse or under florescent lights. If using lights, make sure that they are suspended a few inches above seedlings and put them on a timer, making sure to give plants 14-16 hours of light a day. As the plants get taller, be sure to keep raising the lights so that they are 2-3 inches above the tallest plant.

12. Check seedlings daily and water when the soil appears dry. As young plants grow, they need to be fed. Following the label instructions, add the correct amount of liquid seaweed and fish emulsion to your watering can and drench plants weekly.

13. When seedlings outgrow their trays, either repot them into larger containers, or if the weather is warm enough, start transitioning them outside.

13. It’s important to “harden off” young plants before putting them into the garden, otherwise they will be shocked by the sudden change in temperature. Set trays in a sheltered spot outside, (cover with a tent made of frost cloth) increasing the amount of time they are out each day. This helps the young plants acclimate to outdoor temperature fluctuations. Once all danger of frost has passed they can be planted into the garden.

SOW:

* start 6 to 8 weeks before last frost date 
* use good potting soil, in flats or plug cells
* germination is easy and usually begins within 6 to 14 days
* best temps between 65 and 75 °F (18 and 24 °C).
* do not cover the seeds as light aids germination
* transplant to small pots and grow on until small plants
* harden off before transplanting out. 
* harden so on a cloudy day with likelihood of rain 

GROW:

HARVEST:

Harvest after flowers have dropped and seed pods appear. Expect a vase life of at least a week.

* leaves can be picked eight to nine weeks after seed sowing 
* or as soon as five to six weeks after planting cuttings. 
* they can be continuously harvested over a long season. 
* Jewels of Opar does not bolt, so it is a source of leafy greens far longer than many vegetables. 
* Flower inflorescences should be removed often to continue abundant leaf growth. 
* For seed multiplication, the seeds should be harvested when fruits darken and are dry on the plant. 
* Regular harvesting and planting in containers or other enclosed spaces are ways to mitigate against weediness.
