My notes on various flowers...

## Dahlias


* They are considered a tender perennial in cold regions North America
* Extremely cold sensitive
* Dahlias brighten up any sunny garden with a growing season that’s at least 120 days long
* Dahlias start blooming about 8 weeks after planting, starting in mid-July
* Choose a location with a bit of protection from the wind.

### When to plant

* Plant when ground has warmed to 60°F, normally about 2 weeks after your last spring frost. **May 7** 

### How to plant

* Dig a hole that’s about 4 to 6 inches deep
* Set the tubers into it, with the growing points, or “eyes,” facing up, and cover with 2 to 3 inches of soil (some say 1 inch is adequate). 
* As the stem sprouts, fill in with soil until it is at ground level.
* Do not water the tubers right after planting; this encourages rot. Wait until the sprouts have appeared above the soil to water.
* Do not bother mulching the plants. The mulch harbors slugs and dahlias like the sun on their roots.

### Watering

* There’s no need to water the soil until the dahlia plants appear; in fact, overwatering can cause tubers to rot.
* Once any foliage emerges from the ground, water deeply 2 or 3 times a week for at least 30 minutes.

### Nutrition

* Side dress with a complete granular fertilizer, such as 10-10-10, when tubers begin to sprout
* Liquid fertilizer (300-600 ppm N) once every 2 weeks

### Care

* Will require support (see **corral method** below)
* When plants are about 1 foot tall, pinch out 3-4 inches of the growing center branch to encourage bushier plants and to increase stem count and stem length.
* If you want to grow large flowers try disbudding—removing the 2 smaller buds next to the central one in the flower cluster. This allows the plant to put all of its energy into fewer but considerably larger flowers.
* Bedding dahlias need no staking or disbudding; simply pinch out the growing point to encourage bushiness, and deadhead as the flowers fade. Pinch the center shoot just above the third set of leaves.
* For the taller dahlias, insert stakes at planting time. Moderately pinch, disbranch, and disbud, and deadhead to produce a showy display for 3 months or more.

### Pests/Diseases

* Slugs and snails are dahlias’ number one enemy.
* Put down bait about 2 weeks after planting, or as soon as you see foliage emerging from the ground, and then periodically through the season. **Sluggo** is an organic option that’s safe for both children and pets
* Mites: To avoid spider mites, spray beginning in late July and continue to spray through September. Speak to your garden center about recommended sprays for your area.
* Earwigs and Cucumber Beetle: They can eat the petals though they do not hurt the plant itself.
* Powdery Mildew: This commonly shows up in the fall. You can preventatively spray before this issue arises from late July to August.

### Harvest

* Cut the stems in the morning before the heat of the day and put them into a bucket with cool water. Remove bottom leaves from the stems and place the dahlias in a vase. Put the vase in a cool spot and check the water daily. The bouquet should last about a week.
* Dig up your dahlias before your hard frost. (10/5 is average first frost)
* After fall frost has blackened the foliage, cut off all but 2 to 4 inches of top growth.
* Carefully dig around tubers with a pitchfork (or shovel) without damaging them.
* Lift and gently shake the soil off the tubers.
* Cut rotten tubers off the clump and leave the clumps outside in the sun upside down to dry naturally

Storing dahlia tubers

* Pack in a loose, fluffy material (vermiculite, dry sand, Styrofoam peanuts).
* Store in a well-ventilated, frost-free place—40 to 45º F is ideal, 35 to 50º F is acceptable.

Re-planting tubers in spring

* Take out the tubers in the spring, separate healthy tubers from the parent clump, and plant in the garden. 
* Each tuber must have at least one “eye” or a piece of the crown attached or it will not develop into a blooming plant. The eyes are located at the base of the stem and look like little pink bumps.

### Starting dahlias from seeds

from [gardeningknowhow.com/](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/ornamental/bulbs/dahlia/starting-dahlia-seeds.htm)

* Sow your seeds on the surface of the mixture and cover lightly with a dusting of the medium. 
* Moisten the medium and keep moderately damp, moving the flats to a warm location of at least 70 degrees F.
* **Germination** will occur in 7 to 12 days after sowing. 
* Once the seedlings are large enough that their leaves are touching, individually pot them up in 3-inch containers. 
* Harden the seedlings off before planting them out into prepared garden beds.
* Wait to plant them outdoors until all danger of frost has passed.
* Alternatively, you can plant them outdoors a week before the date of the last frost. In northern climates this may not give the plants enough time to develop and bloom. 
* If cold temperatures threaten at the end of summer, repot the plants and move them into a greenhouse or indoors. They won’t have much tuber development and the best way to save them for next season is to let them go dormant indoors where icy temperatures can’t damage the tiny root and tuber system. Harden them off the next season and plant outdoors.

## Support

* **corral method** -  place a metal T-post every 10 feet along the outside of the beds and then stringing a double layer of baling twine from post to post to corral the plants in.
