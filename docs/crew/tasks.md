## Workflow

The following will step you through the workflow for finding, working and completing issues:

1. Review the [open issues](https://github.com/ohiobarn/flowerfarm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). You are looking for issues labeled `help wanted`.
1. Read the issue and if you have questions add a comment and ask for clarification. Then apply the `question` label to the issue.
1. Once you find an issue that you can work on, either you have no questions or a previous questions was sufficiently answered, remove the `question` label if applied, and assign yourself to the issue then apply the `doing` label.
1. Use the comments for planning. Note when you think you will be on site working the issue or if there is some question about how to approach the task, note your approach once you decide.  Lastly, you can continue to ask questions by mentioning `@tonygilkerson` in the comment.  If the question is small the mention is all that is needed, however, if the question is blocking or you don't have supplies apply the `blocked` label post the issue number on slack in the `#obff-crew` channel
1. When you are finished  with  the issue simply click the `close issue` button
