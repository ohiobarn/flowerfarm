# 1099

Most crew members are independent contractors that need to file a 1099 tax form. A 1099 Form reports income from self employment earnings, interest and dividends, government payments, and more. 

## Independent contractor income

Workers earning a salary or wage, report annual earnings on Form W-2. However, as an independent contractor you will receive a Form **1099-MISC** from the Ohio Barn Flower Farm if you earn at least $600 during the tax year.
